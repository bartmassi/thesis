Code for manipulating a SQL database with experiment data. ACTIVELY USED AND UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

This code is for analyzing behavior collected from non-human primates performing an arithmetic task, 
that requires them to add and subtract small quantities. Data is stored in a sqlite database that
is not publically available. 

For most purposes, 'test.py' is the driver and contains multiple independent scripts for conducting analysis and visualizing data. In general, each code cell represents an independent script.
