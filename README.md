Code for manipulating a SQL database with experiment data. UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

This code is for analyzing behavior collected from non-human primates performing an arithmetic task, 
that requires them to add and subtract small quantities. Data is stored in a sqlite database that
is not publically available. 

This code is under active development!
